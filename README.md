Some ideas for a few things to try

* Finish Spotify quiz
* Beer logger - take images of beer bottles/cans log and create user searchable beer thingy
* Data Viz of longest football league away days by distance, league, mode transport
* Live retro football result vid printer - could use ness.css to give classic ceffax feel
* Pick random album - source discogs collection,Spotify library, Spotify catalog
* Convert setlist to playlist
* Live twitter heat map - who/what is getting more positive tweets, sentiment analysis etc
* Web drum machine/sampler
